The "Customer Lifetime Value Prediction" notebook aims to predict the LTV for customers based on historical transaction data. It employs various data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques to derive valuable insights and generate LTV predictions.

### Data Description

The notebook utilizes a dataset containing customer transaction records, including purchase dates, revenue generated, and customer identifiers. The data is crucial for building the predictive model and gaining a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior.

### Notebook Structure

The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** The dataset is loaded and explored to gain insights into its structure and characteristics.

2. **Feature Engineering:** The relevant features are extracted and transformed to enhance the predictive power of the model.

3. **Data Preprocessing:** Data is cleaned, and categorical columns are converted to numerical form for machine learning compatibility.

4. **Customer Segmentation:** The notebook performs segmentation of customers based on Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) scores.

5. **LTV Prediction:** The LTV is predicted using machine learning techniques, and clustering is applied to form LTV segments.

6. **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is assessed using various evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
